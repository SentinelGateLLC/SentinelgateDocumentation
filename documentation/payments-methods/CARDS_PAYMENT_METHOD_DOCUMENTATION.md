## ❓ Common Questions from Customers

### Q: Where is the CVV/CVC number?

**For Visa, Mastercard, Discover:**

- **Digits:** 3 digits
- **Example:** 123

**For American Express:**
- **Location:** Front of card (above card number)
- **Digits:** 4 digits
- **Example:** 1234

### Q: Why do I need to enter an OTP?

The OTP (One-Time Password) is for **your security**:
- Confirms you authorized the payment
- Prevents someone else from using your card
- Required by your bank for large transactions
- Standard security practice worldwide

### Q: Is it safe to save my card?

**YES, it's safe when you see "Powered by Sentinel"**

When you save a card:
- We store only a secure "token" (not your full card number)
- Your actual card details are kept by secure payment processors
- You can delete saved cards anytime
- Makes future payments faster and easier

**Never save cards on:**
- Unsecured websites (no HTTPS padlock)
- Unknown or suspicious merchants
- Public or shared devices

### Q: What if I don't receive the OTP?

**Try these steps:**

1. **Wait 60 seconds** - Sometimes SMS is delayed
2. **Check spam/junk** - For email OTPs
3. **Click "Resend OTP"** - Request a new code
4. **Contact your bank** - They can verify your phone number
5. **Try alternative method** - Use bank app if SMS fails

### Q: Can I use my card internationally?

**Yes!** Most cards work internationally:

✅ **Visa & Mastercard:** Accepted worldwide  
✅ **American Express:** Most countries (check merchant)  
✅ **Verve:** Nigeria and some African countries  

**Note:** Your bank may charge international transaction fees (typically 2-3%)

### Q: How long does payment take?

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Entering card details | 30-60 seconds |
| 3D Secure verification | 30-60 seconds |
| Payment processing | 2-10 seconds |
| **Total** | **~2 minutes** |

Funds are deducted immediately, but may show as "pending" for 1-3 days.

### Q: What if my payment fails?

**Common reasons & solutions:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Insufficient Funds** | Check your balance, try another card |
| **Card Expired** | Check expiry date, use valid card |
| **Wrong CVV** | Double-check the 3-digit code |

## 🔐 How to Stay Safe When Paying Online

### ✅ DO:

- **Check for HTTPS** - Look for the padlock 🔒 in your browser
- **Verify the merchant** - Make sure you're on the correct website
- **Use secure networks** - Avoid public WiFi for payments
- **Keep records** - Save receipts and transaction IDs
- **Enable notifications** - Get SMS alerts for all transactions
- **Use strong passwords** - For merchant accounts
- **Log out after paying** - Especially on shared devices

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Share your CVV** - NEVER give it over phone or email

- **Use public computers** - For financial transactions
- **Save cards on unfamiliar sites** - Only on trusted merchants

### 🚨 Red Flags - When NOT to Pay:

❌ Website doesn't have HTTPS (no padlock)  
❌ Spelling errors in website URL  
❌ Unusually low prices (too good to be true)  
❌ Pressure to pay immediately  
❌ Request to pay via email or messaging apps  
❌ Asking for card details via email  
❌ No contact information for the seller

## 🆘 What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Don't panic** - This is usually a temporary hold
2. **Check your bank statement** - One charge may be pending

4. **Wait 3-5 days** - Duplicate charges are usually reversed automatically
5. **Dispute if needed** - Contact your bank if not resolved

### If You Didn't Authorize a Charge:

**Act immediately:**

1. **Contact your bank** - Report unauthorized transaction
2. **Freeze your card** - Prevent further unauthorized charges

5. **Monitor your statements** - Check for other suspicious activity

### If You Need a Refund:

1. **Contact the merchant first** - Most refunds are processed by merchants
2. **Provide transaction details** - Transaction ID, date, amount
3. **Wait 5-10 business days** - Standard refund processing time
4. **Check your statement** - Refund may show as a credit
5. **Dispute if needed** - If merchant doesn't respond within 14 days

    const cardElement = sentinel.elements.create('card');
    cardElement.mount('#card-element');

    document.getElementById('pay-button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
      const result = await sentinel.confirmPayment({
        amount: 10000,
        currency: 'USD',

### Method 3: Direct API

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Custom UX
- ✅ Advanced features

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires PCI compliance
- ⚠️ More complex

**Example:**

```javascript
// 1. Tokenize card (client-side)
const token = await sentinel.createToken({
  number: '4242424242424242',
  exp_month: 12,
  exp_year: 2027,
  cvc: '123'
});

// 2. Create payment (server-side)
const payment = await sentinel.payments.create({
  amount: 10000,
  currency: 'USD',
  card_token: token.id,
  customer: {
    email: 'customer@example.com'
  }
});
```

## 🔔 Webhooks

### Why Use Webhooks?

Webhooks notify your server when events happen:
- Payment succeeded
- Payment failed  
- Refund processed
- Chargeback received

**Benefits:**
- Real-time updates
- No polling required
- Reliable delivery
- Automatic retries

### Setting Up Webhooks

**1. Create Endpoint**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', 
  express.raw({type: 'application/json'}), 
  async (req, res) => {
    const signature = req.headers['x-sentinel-signature'];
    const payload = req.body;
    
    // Verify signature
    if (!verifySignature(payload, signature)) {
      return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
    }
    
    const event = JSON.parse(payload);
    
    // Handle event
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'payment.succeeded':
        await fulfillOrder(event.data);
        break;
      case 'payment.failed':
        await notifyCustomer(event.data);
        break;
      case 'refund.succeeded':
        await updateOrder(event.data);
        break;
    }
    
    res.status(200).send('OK');
  }
);
```

**2. Verify Signatures**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(payload, signature) {
  const secret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(hash)
  );
}
```

**3. Register Webhook URL**

Via Dashboard:
1. Settings → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yoursite.com/webhook`
3. Copy webhook secret
4. Save

Via API:
```javascript
await sentinel.webhooks.create({
  url: 'https://yoursite.com/webhook',
  events: ['payment.*', 'refund.*']
});
```

### Webhook Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `payment.created` | Payment intent created |
| `payment.processing` | Payment being processed |
| `payment.succeeded` | Payment completed |
| `payment.failed` | Payment failed |
| `payment.canceled` | Payment canceled |
| `refund.created` | Refund initiated |
| `refund.succeeded` | Refund completed |
| `refund.failed` | Refund failed |
| `chargeback.created` | Chargeback filed |
| `chargeback.won` | You won dispute |
| `chargeback.lost` | You lost dispute |

### Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "payment.succeeded",
  "created_at": "2026-02-12T17:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "pay_abc123xyz",
    "amount_cents": 10000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "card": {
      "last4": "4242",
      "brand": "visa"
    },
    "customer": {
      "email": "customer@example.com"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "order_id": "ORD-12345"
    }
  }
}
```

### Retry Logic

Webhooks are retried automatically:
- **Retry 1:** After 5 seconds
- **Retry 2:** After 1 minute
- **Retry 3:** After 10 minutes
- **Retry 4:** After 1 hour
- **Retry 5:** After 6 hours

**Your endpoint should:**
- Return 200 status quickly (< 5 seconds)
- Process async if needed
- Be idempotent (handle duplicates)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Mode

Use sandbox credentials:

```bash
MERCHANT_ID=test_merch_abc123
API_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
API_SECRET=test_xxxxx
```

**Sandbox Environment:**
- No real money processed
- Instant settlement
- All features available
- Reset data anytime

### Test Cards

**Successful Payments:**

```
Visa:       4242 4242 4242 4242
Mastercard: 5555 5555 5555 4444
Amex:       3782 822463 10005

CVV:        Any 3 digits (123)
Expiry:     Any future date (12/27)
Name:       Any name
```

**Test Scenarios:**

```
# 3D Secure Required
Visa: 4000 0027 6000 3184

# Declined - Insufficient Funds
Visa: 4000 0000 0000 9995

# Declined - Stolen Card
Visa: 4000 0000 0000 9979

# Declined - Lost Card
Visa: 4000 0000 0000 9987

# Processing Error
Visa: 4000 0000 0000 0101

# Expired Card
Visa: 4000 0000 0000 0069
```

### Testing Webhooks

**Use webhook.site:**

1. Go to https://webhook.site
2. Copy unique URL
3. Add as webhook endpoint
4. Make test payment
5. See webhook payload in real-time

**Or use ngrok locally:**

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Start your local server
node server.js

# Create tunnel
ngrok http 3000

# Use ngrok URL as webhook
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook
```

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Expose Secrets

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Hard-coded secrets
const apiKey = 'sk_live_abc123';

// ✅ CORRECT - Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.SENTINEL_API_KEY;
```

**Use .env file:**

```bash
# .env (DO NOT COMMIT TO GIT!)
SENTINEL_MERCHANT_ID=merch_abc123
SENTINEL_API_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
SENTINEL_API_SECRET=xxxxx
WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

**Add to .gitignore:**

```bash
# .gitignore
.env
.env.local
.env.production
credentials/
secrets/
```

### 2. Validate All Input

```javascript
// Validate amount
function validatePayment(data) {
  if (!data.amount || data.amount < 100) {
    throw new Error('Minimum amount is $1.00');
  }
  
  if (data.amount > 1000000) {
    throw new Error('Maximum amount is $10,000.00');
  }
  
  // Validate currency
  const validCurrencies = ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'KES'];
  if (!validCurrencies.includes(data.currency)) {
    throw new Error('Unsupported currency');
  }
  
  // Validate email
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(data.email)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
}
```

### 3. Implement Rate Limiting

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // 100 requests per window
  message: 'Too many requests'
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

### 4. Use HTTPS Only

```javascript
// Force HTTPS
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.header('x-forwarded-proto') !== 'https') {
    return res.redirect(`https://${req.header('host')}${req.url}`);
  }
  next();
});
```

### 5. Sanitize User Input

```javascript
const validator = require('validator');

function sanitize(input) {
  return validator.escape(input.trim());
}

// Use in routes
app.post('/payment', (req, res) => {
  const email = sanitize(req.body.email);
  const name = sanitize(req.body.name);
  // ...
});
```

### 6. Log Securely

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Logs sensitive data
console.log('Payment:', {
  cardNumber: req.body.cardNumber,
  cvv: req.body.cvv
});

// ✅ CORRECT - Logs safely
console.log('Payment:', {
  paymentId: payment.id,
  amount: payment.amount,
  last4: payment.card.last4
});
```

## 📖 Glossary

### For Everyone

**3D Secure (3DS):** Extra security step where you verify payment with your bank (OTP, app approval, etc.)

**Authorization:** When merchant checks if you have enough money (holds the amount temporarily)

**Card Network:** Companies that process card payments (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)

**Chargeback:** When customer disputes a charge with their bank

**CVV/CVC:** 3-digit security code on back of card (4 digits for Amex on front)

**Issuer:** Your bank (the one that issued your card)

**Merchant:** Business selling goods/services

**OTP:** One-Time Password sent by your bank

**PCI DSS:** Security standards for handling card data

**Refund:** Money returned to customer

**Settlement:** When money moves from customer's bank to merchant's bank

**Token:** Secure reference to card details (instead of storing full number)

### For Developers

**API:** Application Programming Interface (how systems talk to each other)

**Endpoint:** Specific URL for API operation (e.g., /payments)

**Idempotency:** Same request produces same result (safe to retry)

**Sandbox:** Test environment with fake money

**SDK:** Software Development Kit (pre-built code library)

**Webhook:** Server notification when event happens
